# This controls which themes are installed (`installed: true`) and which one
# will be configured as the default for all non-root users (`default: true`).
# The `theme` corresponds to the name of a task file under `tasks/`.
# Only one theme should have `default` set, otherwise it is undefined behaviour
# whether an error is thrown or one of them is effectively set as the default.
# `installed` and `default` can be omitted and default to `false`.
