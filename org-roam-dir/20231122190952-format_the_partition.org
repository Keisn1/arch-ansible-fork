** Chat Gipiti
^64bit: The caret (^) symbol before 64bit means "exclude" in this context. So, -O ^64bit is excluding the 64-bit feature from the filesystem being created.
The 64bit feature in ext4 filesystem allows the filesystem to support larger files and use extents for better performance. However, there might be situations where you want to create a filesystem without the 64-bit feature, possibly for compatibility reasons with certain systems or devices that do not support it.
