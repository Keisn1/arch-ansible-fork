Arch-Ansible is a playbook designed to install Arch Linux on a target
machine. It was conceived to ease the preparation of virtual machines,
but it can also be used to install on bare metal.

The simplest way to get started is to provision a VM with Arch Linux to
try the playbook out. First, change some default settings by writing the
following YAML snippet to `ansible/group_vars/all/50-user-settings.yaml`
and customize it to suit your regional settings:

```yaml
# Set your timezone, locale and keymap
locale_timezone: Europe/Rome
locale_locale: it_IT.UTF-8
locale_keymap: it
users_root_info:
    # Choose a root password
    password: "abcd$1234_root"
users_info:
  # Change "manu" to your username
  manu:
    # Choose a password for your user.
    # You'll be able to use sudo.
    password: "abcd$1234_manu"
    is_admin: true
```

Now, if you want Packer to build a brand new VirtualBox VM image, type:

```sh
cd packer
packer build packer-template.json
```

or, if you prefer to spin up a turn-key Vagrant machine, again backed by
VirtualBox, go with:

```sh
cd vagrant
# A reload is required should the kernel be upgraded
vagrant up && vagrant reload
```

There's a good deal of things that can be customized: DE themes,
preinstalled utilities, screensaver behaviour and more. Have a look at
the [documentation][docs] for more information.
